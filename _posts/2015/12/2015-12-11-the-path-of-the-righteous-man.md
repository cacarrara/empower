<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother&#39;s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>

<p>Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody lived by the same standards I did, then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where righteousness is not rewarded. That&#39;s Cesar&#39;s world, and if you&#39;re not willing to play by his rules, then you&#39;re gonna have to pay the price.</p>

<p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I&#39;m not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain&#39;s going to be? He&#39;s the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they&#39;re friends, like you and me! I should&#39;ve known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>
