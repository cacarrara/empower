<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&#39;s called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they&#39;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&#39;t, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.&nbsp;</p>
