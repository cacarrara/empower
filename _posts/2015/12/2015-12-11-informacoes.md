<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&#39;s called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they&#39;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&#39;t, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

<p>Look, just because I don&#39;t be givin&#39; no man a foot massage don&#39;t make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin&#39; house, fuckin&#39; up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, &#39;cause I&#39;ll kill the motherfucker, know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?</p>
